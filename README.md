- I didn't actually get to the point where I could use the second table because I faced a lot of errors but I had a go at the sorting queries instead

## Reflection

- I think this week's assignment was actually quite challenging due to how many different part we had to do. I also struggled a lot with setting up the connections initially which took me the longest time
- I set up all my connections on a call with someone else because we found that it was a lot easier to spot mistakes and it made the process a lot smoother

## What bugs did I encounter? ü™≤

- Initially, when setting up the POST endpoint, i came across a lot of issues becuase I had written my status error incorrectly so it kept going straight to the catch statement
- I also had an issue with broken images image tags when displaying my reviews. I found i useful site to handle _onError_ which allowed me to displa a default image if this happened.
- I had some issues with the react-router-dom because I forgot to import 'BrowserRouter' into my main.jsx ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
